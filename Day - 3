Creating an AWS S3 Bucket Using Terraform — Complete Step-by-Step Guide

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) simplifies cloud resource management, and Terraform is one of the most powerful tools available for provisioning infrastructure reliably and repeatably.
In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to configure AWS credentials, initialize Terraform, deploy an S3 bucket, inspect the state, and finally clean up resources.

🧩 Step 1: Configure AWS Credentials

Before Terraform can interact with AWS, export your credential environment variables:

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="eu-north-1"


These allow Terraform to authenticate with AWS securely without exposing secrets in files.

🧱 Step 2: Create Your Terraform Configuration

Create a file (e.g., main.tf) and add the following:

terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = ">= 5.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-north-1"
}

# create an S3 bucket
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "SampleAWSTerraform" {
  bucket = "awsterrafrombucket"

  tags = {
    Name        = "Sample Bucket"
    Environment = "Test"
  }
}


This configuration specifies:

AWS provider configuration

Region (eu-north-1)

An S3 bucket with tags

⚙️ Step 3: Initialize Terraform

Before running any Terraform commands, initialize your working directory:

terraform init


This downloads the AWS provider and prepares Terraform to run.

🔍 Step 4: Validate the Configuration

Ensure your Terraform code syntax is correct:

terraform validate


If everything is valid, you’ll get:

Success! The configuration is valid.

📝 Step 5: Generate the Execution Plan

Preview the changes Terraform will apply:

terraform plan


Terraform displays an execution plan showing that 1 resource will be created (your S3 bucket).
This step allows you to confirm the expected changes.

🚀 Step 6: Apply the Changes

Deploy your infrastructure:

terraform apply


Terraform will ask for confirmation:

Do you want to perform these actions?
Enter a value: yes


After typing yes, the S3 bucket will be created.

You should see:

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

📄 Step 7: View the Current State

To inspect the deployed resource:

terraform show


This displays everything Terraform is managing, including the S3 bucket details such as ARN, region, and tags.

🧹 Step 8: Destroy the Resources

When you're done and want to clean up:

terraform destroy


Confirm destruction with yes.
Terraform removes all managed resources, ensuring a clean environment.
