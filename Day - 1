Day - 1️⃣: Understanding Terraform - What It Is & Why It Matters in Cloud Engineering

As Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) becomes the backbone of modern cloud operations, one tool consistently stands out: Terraform.

🔥 What is Terraform?
Terraform is an open-source IaC tool that lets you build, change, and manage cloud infrastructure using code.

 Instead of clicking around dashboards, you define everything in simple configuration files and Terraform automates the rest.

❓ Why do we need Terraform?
✔ Automation – No more manual setup. Deploy entire environments in minutes.
 ✔ Consistency – Same code = same infrastructure every time.
 ✔ Version control – Track and review infra change like application code.
 ✔ Multi - cloud support – Works across AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, GitHub, and more.
 ✔ Scalability – Easily replicate environments (dev, staging, prod) with the same templates.

Terraform makes infrastructure predictable, repeatable, and safe.

❓ How is Terraform different from other tools?

Terraform vs CloudFormation:

✅ Terraform works across multiple cloud providers
❌ CloudFormation is AWS-only


Terraform vs Ansible:

✅ Terraform provisions infrastructure
❌ Ansible configures applications inside the infrastructure


Terraform vs Pulumi:

✅Terraform uses HCL (simple and declarative)
❌ Pulumi uses languages like Python/TS (flexible but more complex)
